This app was built using React and is fully responsive. I personally designed it, making use of Tailwind CSS for the visual styling. The navigation system was implemented using React Router, ensuring smooth transitions between different sections. All the information displayed in the app is obtained from the TMDb API, providing up-to-date and comprehensive data. The user-friendly interface enables easy navigation through a vast collection of movie catalogs sorted by genre. Additionally, users can browse through a general catalog that features recently trending films. Furthermore, users can access detailed information about each movie by visiting its dedicated page. From there, the app provides the ability to discover similar content by utilizing the genre-sorted lists mentioned earlier.
